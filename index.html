  <h1>Nigerian Egusi Soup</h1>
  <h2>Brief Notes</h2>
  <p>This is a creamy, nutty staple that varies from region to region, with each region having slightly different techniques. This soup takes its name from <u>Egusi</u>, or <u>Agushi</u>; the seeds that both thicken and flavour it.
    Egusi Soup typically features meat (such as beef, smoked poultry, goat, cow skin, and seafood), as well as awara (Nigerian Tofu), mushrooms, and greens.</p>

- 1 medium red onion (about 6 ounces; 175g), roughly chopped<br>
- <mark> 1/2 </mark> Fresh habanero or Scotch bonnet pepper, stemmed (optional)<br>
- <mark>2</mark> cups (10 ounces; 300g) ground egusi seeds.<br>
- <mark>3/4</mark> cup unrefined red palm oil (5 1/4 ounces; 150g), such as Obiji.<br>
- Kosher salt and Nigerian red dry pepper<br>
- 1 teaspoon ground crayfish.<br>
- 3 1/2 ounces (100g) fresh pumpkin leaves, amaranth greens, or kale, rinsed and finely chopped<br>
- 3 1/2 ounces (100g) fresh waterleaf or spinach, rinsed and finely chopped<br>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<p>1.&nbsp;For the Stock: In a medium pot, combine beef, onion, crayfish, salt, red pepper, and 6 1/2 cups water and bring to
a boil. Lower heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the stock is slightly reduced and the beef is mostly
tender, about 45 minutes <mark>(the beef will tenderize further when cooked in the soup).</mark> Using a slotted spoon,
remove beef and transfer to a medium heatproof bowl; set aside. Reserve stock (you should have about 5 1/2
cups).</p><br>

<p>2.&nbsp;For the Egusi Soup: In a food processor or countertop blender, process onion, habanero pepper (if using), and
1/4 cup water until smooth. Scrape into a medium bowl and stir in ground egusi seeds. Add water, 1 tablespoon
at a time, until a thick, creamy paste has formed <mark>(paste should be viscous and hold its shape).</mark> Set aside.</p><br>

<p>3.&nbsp;In a 4-quart saucepan, heat oil over low heat for 1 minute. Slowly add all of the reserved stock, along with
crayfish, and bring to a gentle simmer. Add paste, 1 heaped teaspoon at a time, to stock. Cover and cook, stirring
and gently scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until all paste is firm and crumbly, about 25 minutes
<mark>(patches of orange-red palm oil may bubble on top or around sides).</mark></p><br>

<p>4.&nbsp;Add reserved beef and stir gently to break up the cooked paste into curds (stirring more or less affects the size
of the curds). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue to cook until beef is heated through and tender,
and some orange-red palm oil pools on top, about 10 minutes.</p><br>

<p>5.&nbsp;Mound pumpkin leaves and waterleaf on top of soup without stirring, then cover and let steam until greens are wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir in wilted greens. Add bitter leaf and cook until soft, about 8 minutes.</p><br>
